  <h2>Mesh - test examples</h2>
  <p>
    This file loads <code>index.js</code> which contains examples that use the
    Mesh API. See the console log for test output.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tests make two updates to the same data, but they occur in random
    order. The "species" field is then logged and should match the update that
    happened last.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>index.js</code> file is loaded as a module, which allows it to
    import the development build of Mesh. You can switch to the production
    build by changing the import path at the top of the file.
  </p>

    See <a href="/examples/user.html">user.html</a> for examples that test the
    Mesh.user API.

    See <a href="/examples/wire.html">wire.html</a> for examples that test the
